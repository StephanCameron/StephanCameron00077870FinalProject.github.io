<H2>HISTORY</H2>
<p>The JRPG Music Central website came about during Web Design class with Mrs Nicole Alexander. I have a passion for video game music and would like to have my own website and game shop in the future. The inspiration for this website came from my childhood love for video games and Japanese Role Playing Games. There are alot of testimonials of how video games help people overcome depression and difficult times in their lives. Video games are not just for entertainment, it is a form of therapy for people to escape from the real world to find a way to cope with lifes difficulties adn challenges. It is not a method to be ignorant of the world but to find ways to accept it in a way that can make things productive and communicate positivity.</p>

<strong>Video Game music</strong> helps with focus and on action tasks such as racing, fighting, exploring. It helps drive up dopamine levels to help focus on tasks taht are boring and make it exciting to do, it also adds inspiration to one everyday life. <b><u>Dopamine</u></b> is a chemical in our brains that help us be excitied about things that we like or come across in our lives that interestes us.
